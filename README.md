# Open Closed Eyes Classification

This project aims to classify images of open and closed eyes using the **MRL Eye Dataset**. It leverages **PyTorch** for deep learning, **torchvision** for image preprocessing, and **MLflow** for experiment tracking. The dataset consists of gray-scale  images captured under different lighting conditions and by various devices.


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images into two categories:
- `Open Eye`
- `Closed Eye`

This project is implemented in Python and uses **PyTorch** for model building and training. The training process is tracked and logged using **MLflow**.

## Dataset

The MRL Eye Dataset is a large-scale collection of infrared images of human eyes. This dataset is publicly available [here](http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/eyedataset). 

The dataset is divided into:
- **Open Eyes**
- **Closed Eyes**
